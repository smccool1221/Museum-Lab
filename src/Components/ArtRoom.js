        "Pilgrimage to Cythera by Jean-Antoine Watteau is one of the most important 
        pieces of art in the 18th century. It took 5 years to complete (1717) and 
        was Watteauâ€™s submission to get into the French Royal Academy of
         Painting and Sculpture. His acceptance into the academy with Pilgrimage 
         to Cythera was a key turning point in art history."
